Early Binding and Explicit Type Checking:
To avoid late-binding issues, use early binding whenever possible by declaring object variables with the specific object type.  This allows the compiler to check for type compatibility at compile time rather than runtime.   Also, add explicit type checks before performing operations that might involve incompatible data types.

Example:
```vbscript
Dim obj As Object
On Error Resume Next
Set obj = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
If Err.Number <> 0 Then
  MsgBox "Object creation failed: " & Err.Description
  Err.Clear
  Exit Sub
end if

If obj Is Nothing Then
  MsgBox "Object is null"
  Exit Sub
End If

If obj.FileExists("C:\somefile.txt") Then
  ' Safe to use the object here because we checked for null and errors
  MsgBox "File exists!"
end if

On Error GoTo 0
```

This improved version checks for errors during object creation, handles potential null objects, and implicitly checks object properties before using them to eliminate runtime errors.
